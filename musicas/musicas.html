<h1>Letra -Dust in the Wind</h1>
<audio src="./Dust.mp3"controls></audio><br>

I close my eyes<br>
Only for a moment, and the moment's gone<br>
All my dreams<br>
Pass before my eyes, a curiosity
<br>

Dust in the wind<br>
All they are is dust in the wind<br>
<br>

>ame old song<br>
Just a drop of water in an endless sea<br>
All we do<br>
Crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see<br>
<br>

Dust in the wind (oh)<br>
All we are is dust in the wind<br>
Oh, oh, oh<br>
<br>

Now, don't hang on<br>
Nothing lasts forever, but the Earth and sky<br>
It slips away<br>
And all your money won't another minute bu<br>
<br>

Dust in the wind<br>
All we are is dust in the wind (all we are is dust in the wind)<br>
Dust in the wind (everything is dust in the wind)<br>
Everything is dust in the wind<br>
The wind<br>
<br>
    
<h1>Letra -Carry on Wayward Son</h1>
<audio src="./Carry.mp3"controls></audio><br>
<p>Carry on, my wayward son<br>
There'll be peace when you are done<br>
Lay your weary head to rest<br>
Don't you cry no more<br>
<br>
Once I rose above the noise and confusion<br>
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion<br>
I was soaring ever higher<br>
But I flew too high<br>
Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man<br>
Though my mind could think, I still was a mad man<br>
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming<br>
I can hear them say<br>
<br>
Carry on, my wayward son<br>
There'll be peace when you are done<br>
Lay your weary head to rest<br>
Don't you cry no more<br>
<br>
Masquerading as a man with a reason<br>
My charade is the event of the season<br>
And if I claim to be a wise man, well<br>
It surely means that I don't know<br>
On a stormy sea of moving emotion<br>
Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean<br>
I set a course for winds of fortune<br>
But I hear the voices say<br>
<br>
Carry on my wayward son<br>
There'll be peace when you are done<br>
Lay your weary head to rest<br>
Don't you cry no more, no<br>
<br>
Carry on, you will always remember<br>
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor<br>
Now your life's no longer empty<br>
Surely heaven waits for you<br>
<br>
Carry on, my wayward son<br>
There'll be peace when you are done<br>
Lay your weary head to rest<br>
Don't you cry, don't you cry no more<br>
No more</p>


<h1>Letra -Wind of Change</h1>
<audio src="./Wind.mp3"controls></audio><br>
<p>the Moskva<br>
Down to Gorky Park<br>
Listening to the wind of change<br>
An August summer night<br>
Soldiers passing by<br>
<br>
Listening to the wind of change<br>
The world is closing in<br>
Did you ever think<br>
That we could be so close, like brothers<br>
<br>
The future's in the air<br>
Can feel it everywhere<br>
Blowing with the wind of change<br>
<br>
Take me to the magic of the moment<br>
On a glory night<br>
Where the children of tomorrow dream away<br>
In the wind of change<br>
<br>
Walking down the street<br>
Distant memories<br>
Are buried in the past, forever<br>
<br>
I follow the Moskva<br>
Down to Gorky Park<br>
Listening to the wind of change<br>
<br>
Take me to the magic of the moment<br>
On a glory night<br>
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams<br>
<br>
With you and me<br>
Take me to the magic of the moment<br>
On a glory night<br>
Where the children of tomorrow dream away<br>
In the wind of change<br>
The wind of change<br>
<br>
Blows straight into the face of time<br>
Like a storm wind that will ring the freedom bell<br>
For peace of mind<br>
Let your balalaika sing<br>
What my guitar wants to say<br>
<br>
Take me to the magic of the moment<br>
On a glory night<br>
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams<br>
With you and me<br>
<br>
Take me to the magic of the moment<br>
On a glory night<br>
Where the children of tomorrow dream away<br>
In the wind of change</p>
